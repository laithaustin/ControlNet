            "-------------------- Question:\n",
            "A South African cardinal who helped elect Pope Francis has described paedophilia as a psychological illness and not 'a criminal condition'. The Catholic Archbishop of Durban, Wilfrid Fox Napier, told BBC Radio 5 live that people who were abused as children and became paedophiles were not criminally responsible for their actions in the same way as somebody 'who chooses to do something like that'. Cardinal Napier, who was among the 115 cardinals in the conclave at the Vatican that elected Pope Francis earlier this week, called paedophilia a 'psychological disorder. And just three days into the new role, the pope and the Catholic Church are now faced with fresh child abuse controversy after the cardinal's remarks. Newly elected Pope Francis (right), is given a yellow Catholic faith bracelet by Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier of South Africa following a meeting at the Vatican (left). The South African cardinal claimed that paedophilia is an 'illness' He said: 'What do you do with disorders? You have got to try and put them right. 'If I as a normal being choose to break the law knowing that I am breaking the law, then I think I need to be punished... 'From my experience paedophilia is actually an illness, it is not a criminal condition, it is an illness.' The cardinal spoke of two priests he knew who were abused as children and went on to become paedophiles. He told the BBC: 'Don't tell me that those people are criminally responsible like somebody who chooses to do something like that. The cardinal said that in his experience, paedophilia is an illness, not a criminal condition, and the people who have been abused as children and then molest others are 'damaged' Pope Francis explained to journalists in an audience today that he wants a 'church for the poor' 'I don't think you can really take the position and say that person deserves to be punished when he was himself damaged.' Barbara Dorries, from the US-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests was abused as a child by a priest. She told the BBC: 'If it is a disease that's fine, but it's also a crime and crimes are punished, criminals are held accountable for what they did and what they do. 'The bishops and the cardinals have gone to great lengths to cover these crimes to enable the predators to move on, to not be arrested, to keep the secrets within the church.' The cardinal has made controversial . statements before, maintaining that people should abstain from sex . rather than use contraceptives, to stop spreading HIV. He took the official Roman Catholic . Stance and argued that government programmes to distribute condoms were . ineffectual in stemming the spread of HIV. Instead, he supported programmes based around abstinence. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. The cardinal is a prolific Twitter user, and has kept his followers up to date about the conclave and his meetings with the newly ordained pope. He wrote: 'Last 2 days quite unreal. Mass with Pope Francis in Santa Martha Chapel, Breakfast, Lunch & Supper with him sitting at a different table! 'What's it like in Conclave? Apart from NO radio or TV, NO newspapers or phone calls, Emails or SMS's, NO Twitter or Facebook, all is normal.' 'We chat, discuss, get to know each . other. Meals are special times. We relax, share stories about our home . Churches, dream about the future!' His remarks came on the day that the pope held a private meeting with journalists. Pope Francis has said he wants 'a poor Church, for the poor' following his election as head of the Catholic Church. In . a meeting with journalists, the Pontiff said he was inspired to choose . the name Francis after the 12th Century saint Francis of Assisi. \n",

            "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:02 PM on 6th October 2011 . Protesters calling themselves 'the 99 per . cent' continued to gather momentum in several cities across the country today, with groups descending on on Washington . D.C., Jersey and Texas. The marchers - campaigning against America's richest 'one per cent' with . perceived tax breaks and other perks - have swelled their ranks since mid September, leading President Barack Obama to call the demonstrators a 'movement'. The protests come after an NYPD officer was caught bragging about using his nightstick on Wall Street protesters just hours before violence broke out between demonstrators and police last night. In the video, which appears to have been shot just hours before last night's clashes, the officer can be heard saying 'my little night stick's going to get a work out tonight' as he saunters past a police barricade. Scroll down for video . Stand: About one thousand people gather and form a large \"99%\" in the middle of Freedom Plaza. The chant refers to the richest 1 per cent of Americans which the political right are trying to protect . Spread: Participants march with signs past the White House to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce during an \"Occupation of Washington\" protest in Washington . March: Protesters march in front of the Federal Reserve Building in Dallas today . The protests have slowly grown in size and attention over more than two weeks, with the president's acknowledgement at a news conference a sign they might be jelling into a political movement. Local protests against corporate America are planned in New Jersey on Thursday as a show of solidarity with demonstrations that started last month outside the New York Stock Exchange. Rallies met at the Statehouse in Trenton and in Jersey City. Protesters are expected to call for an end of corporate control of government. The movement has surged in less than three weeks from a ragged group in downtown Manhattan to protesters of all ages demonstrating from Seattle to Tampa. 'I am a mother. I want a better world for my children,' said Lisa Clapier, 46, a producer who lives in Venice, California, who joined protesters in Los Angeles. In Seattle, where protesters had set up an encampment in a city park, about two dozen people were arrested for defying police orders to dismantle their tents. 'The cops are doing their job, and we're going to let them do their job. Then we'll come back and occupy the park again,' said Michael Trimarco, 39, an unemployed carpenter. Spray: A Protester gets pepper sprayed at Occupy Wall Street March . Barricades: Protesters attempt to break through police lines at Wall Street and Broadway . Violence: A video posted on Youtube shows officers swinging their nightsticks at protesters has also sparked furious reaction on blogs and across the internet . Swinging: Police can be seen laying into protesters around Wall Street . Last night unions lent their muscle to the . long-running protest against Wall Street and economic inequality, . fuelling speculation about how long the camp-out in lower Manhattan - . and related demonstrations around the country - will continue. As around 5,000 protesters marched toward the New York Stock Exchange last night, demonstrators tried to storm the barricades but were stopped by police . about two blocks away. There were multiple reports of police using pepper spray to try to ward off the marchers. A video posted on Youtube shows officers swinging their nightsticks at protesters and has sparked a furious reaction among demonstrators. Police said about 28 arrests were made, mostly . for disorderly conduct. One person was arrested for assaulting an . officer; police said the officer was pushed off his scooter. Thousands of protesters, including many in union T-shirts, filled lower Manhattan's Foley Square on yesterday and then marched to Zuccotti Park, where the protesters have been camping since September 17. Line: Police officers try to restore barricades after Occupy Wall Street protesters tried to get past them and march to Wall Street . Famous: Tim Robbins speaks to Occupy Wall Street protesters at the start of a rally held at Foley Square, Manhattan . Cuffed: The protests have gathered momentum and gained participants in recent days as news of mass arrests and a coordinated media campaign seeded protests around the country . Earlier Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain told protesters in a Wall Street Journal interview: 'Don't blame Wall Street, don't blame the big banks, if you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself.' But labor leaders say they will continue to support the protests, both with manpower and donations of goods and services. 'The great thing about Occupy Wall Street is that they have brought the focus of the entire country on the middle class majority,' said George Aldro, 62, a member of Local 2325 of the United Auto Workers, as he carried the union's blue flag over his shoulder through lower Manhattan. 'We're in it together, and we're in it for the long haul.' The protesters have varied causes but have spoken largely about unemployment and economic inequality, reserving most of their criticism for Wall Street. 'We are the 99 percent,' they chanted, contrasting themselves with the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. Ed Figueroa, a janitor in a public school in the Bronx and a shop steward with Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, said the march was 'the first time in these weeks that unions have shown their face.' 'But it won't be the last time,' he said. 'We'll be back.' Force: People watch from the steps of Federal Court (L) as members of trade unions join \"Occupy Wall Street\" protesters . Bragging: This NYPD oficer was recorded saying his night stick was 'going to get a workout' just hours before violence broke out last night . The unions were donating food, blankets and office space to the protesters, said Dan Cantor, head of the Working Families Party. But he said the young protesters would continue to head their own efforts. The movement lacks an identified leader and decisions are made during group meetings. 'They're giving more to us than we're giving to them. They're a shot in the arm to everybody,' Cantor said. 'The labor movement is following the youth of America today and that's a good thing.' Victor Rivera, a vice-president for the powerful 1199 Service Employees International Union, which represents health care workers, said the union had donated 'all the food they need for this entire week' to the Zuccotti Park campers. Union leaders had also assigned liaisons from their political action committee to work with demonstrators. 'We are here to support this movement against Wall Street's greed,' he said. 'We support the idea that the rich should pay their fair share.' Fall guy: Protesters affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement rally with a photo of JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in Foley Square . Point: Occupy Wall Street protesters posing as billionaires stage a protest near Wall Street . Agitation: A police officer grabs the arm of a woman at the Occupy Wall Street protest . The Occupy Wall Street protests started Sept. 17 with a few dozen demonstrators who tried to pitch tents in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Since then, hundreds have set up camp nearby in Zuccotti Park and have become increasingly organized, lining up medical aid and legal help and printing their own newspaper. On Saturday, about 700 people were arrested and given disorderly conduct summonses for spilling into the roadway of the Brooklyn Bridge despite warnings from police. A group of those arrested filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying officers lured them into a trap before arresting them. Several Democratic lawmakers have expressed support for the protesters, but some Republican presidential candidates have rebuked them. Herman Cain called the activists 'un-American' Wednesday at a book signing in St. Petersburg, Florida. Mass: Yesterday at new York's Zuccotti Park and Foley Square, Occupy Wall Street protesters were joined by local students and unions . 'They're basically saying that somehow the government is supposed to take from those that have succeeded and give to those who want to protest,' the former pizza-company executive said. 'That's not the way America was built.' On Tuesday, CBS reported that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney called the protest \"class warfare\" at an appearance at a Florida retirement community. Activists have been showing solidarity with the movement in many cities: Occupy Providence. Occupy Los Angeles. Occupy Boise. More protests and sit-ins are planned across the country in the days ahead. Ride: A participant in the \"Occupy Wall Street\" demonstration displays a \"pink unicorn\" ride during a march to join teacher's unions near Wall Street yesterday . Camp: The demonstrators are protesting bank bailouts, foreclosures and high unemployment from their encampment in the financial district . Multitude: Thousands of protesters including union members and college students from an organized walkout joined the rally . On Wednesday, more than 100 people withstood an afternoon downpour in Idaho's capital to protest, including Judy Taylor, a retired property manager. 'I want change. I'm tired of things being taken away from those that need help,' she said. In Seattle, demonstrators tussled with police officers and clung to tents as they defied orders to leave a park. Police said they made 25 arrests. The reception was warmer in Los Angeles, where the City Council approved a resolution of support and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's office distributed 100 rain ponchos to activists at another days-long demonstration, according to City News Service. In Boston, hundreds of nurses and Northeastern University students rallied together to condemn what they called corporate control of government and the spiralling costs of education. The students banged on drums made of water jugs and chanted, 'Banks got bailed out, and we got sold out.' 'This is an organic process. This is a process of grassroots people coming together. It's a beautiful thing,' said David Schildmeier, spokesman for the Massachusetts Nurses Association. Many of those protesting are college students. Hundreds walked out of classes in New York, some in a show of solidarity for the Wall Street movement but many more concerned with worries closer to home. Protests were scheduled at State University of New York campuses including Albany, Buffalo, Binghamton, New Paltz and Purchase. Danielle Kingsbury, a 21-year-old senior from New Paltz, said she walked out of an American literature class to show support for some of her professors who she said have had their workloads increased because of budget cuts. 'The state of education in our country is ridiculous,' said Kingsbury, who plans to teach. 'The state doesn't care about it and we need to fight back about that.' \n",

            "Bookings have surged at the luxury Scottish hotel owned by Andy Murray after it was reported it would be the venue when he weds fiancee Kim Sears. The 27-year-old is understood to be tying the knot with Miss Sears at the £1.8million Cromlix House Hotel, near his hometown of Dunblane in Stirling on April 11. The two-times Grand Slam winner owns the exclusive retreat, where plush suites can cost up to £600 a night. Since it was revealed that Cromlix House would be the venue for the nuptials of the Murray and Miss Sears, pictured, other couples have been snapping up dates at the hotel . The Cromlix House Hotel near Dunblane, where Andy Murray is set to marry fiancee Kim Sears on April 11. The two-times Grand Slam winner owns the £1.8million hotel . And since it was revealed that Cromlix House would be the venue for the nuptials of the 2013 Wimbledon champion, other couples have been snapping up dates at the hotel for their big day, which opened last year after a major refurbishment. A source said: 'There is still some availability at Cromlix into September but it's going fast. 'Interest has really rocketed since Andy announced he was getting married there.' Experts are now predicting that the publicity surrounding the couple's wedding is likley to put the hotel in the same league as other famous venues such as Skibo Castle, near Dornock, where Madonna married film director Guy Ritchie in December 2000. The hotel has its own private chapel, where the privacy conscious couple will be able to say 'I do' away from prying eyes . The wedding party will have 10 bedrooms and five suites to chose from. Pictured: The Eden Room at the luxury hotel . The hotel underwent an extensive redevelopment after it was bought by the tennis ace and re-opened last year where suites can go for up to £600 per night . The couples wedding guests will be able to enjoy pre-ceremony drinks at the hotel bar. Experts predict that ublicity surrounding the couple's wedding is likley to put the hotel in the same league as other famous Scottish venues . Nastasha Radmehr, editor of the Scottish Wedding Directory, said couples will be desperate for some of the tennis star's glamorous celebrity lustre to rub off on their own nuptials. She said: 'It is going to be Scotland’s version of a Royal wedding and the excitement is already building. 'A lot of women really admire Kim and will want to emulate her. After winning the Wimbledon titled in 2013 Murray celebrated by climbing through the crowd to share a kiss with Miss Sears . 'There’s going to be a great deal of media attention and people calling the venue to try to have their weddings there.' Murray presented Miss Sears with a diamond engagement ring which is believed to be worth £200,000 . Murray bought Cromlix in 2013 for £1.8 million and it opened last year after a refurbishment. The privacy conscious couple will be able to say 'I do' away from prying eyes, as the hotel boasts its very own private chapel. The wedding party will also have 10 bedrooms and five suites to chose from, each of which is named after a great Scot, including Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, Robert Burns and even fellow sporting legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Chris Hoy. Several of the luxury suites feature hand-painted freestanding gold, silver and copper baths and the rooms’ 32in televisions screens are disguised as mirrors. The hotel overlooks 34-acres of secluded woodland, manicured grounds and tennis courts. Mr Murray and Miss Sears will also be following in the footsteps of the star's older brother, Jamie, who also got married at Cromlix. He wed Alejandra Guitierrez in a 2010 ceremony, in which Mr Murray acted as best man. Murray, who last weekend reached the final of the Australian Open, proposed to his 27-year-old girlfriend of nine years with a  three-carat diamond engagement ring, believed to be worth around £200,000, in November. Ahead of his proposal Murray, who became the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles title in 2013 since 1936, was repeatedly forced to bat off questions about when he would ask Miss Sears to marry him. Miss Sears is the Sussex-born daughter of the former Lawn Tennis Association Head of Women's Tennis Nigel Sears. The happy couple will be following in the footsteps of Murray's older brother Jamie, who wed Alejandra Gutierrez, at the same venue in 2010 . The tennis player's mother Judy, who appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, has previously described Miss Sears as the 'best thing to happen to Andy' She was just 17 and still studying her A-Levels when she met the up-and-coming tennis player at the US Open in 2005. She was said to have been wooed by the star, who is now said to be worth of £30 million, with a series of phone calls and flowers. The couples relationship became public when Murray, who grew up in Dunblane, Scotland, won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to kiss Miss Sears.

A drug addict was caught red-handed trying to burgle a house when a quick thinking homeowner filmed him on camera as he tried to break in. Bernie Sawford, 58, was working on his computer at his home in Ely, Cambridgeshire, in March when he saw Stephen Neal, 26, in his garden. The grandfather confronted Neal, who was armed with a metal bar, and the would-be thief claimed that he was hiding in the garden because he was being chased. Scroll down for video . Caught red-handed: Stephen Neal, left, was jailed for a year after being caught on camera trying to burgle Bernie Sawford's (right) home . Mr Sawford used a video camera he was using for work to film Neal and called police who arrived minutes later. After Mr Sawford showed officers the film, Neal was arrested nearby just ten minutes later. Neal, from Ely, was jailed for 12 months at Cambridge Crown Court after admitting attempted burglary and possession of an offensive weapon. Mr Sawford said after the sentencing: 'He tried to tell me he was hiding from some people who were after him but I told him he wouldn't be hiding in my garden. 'I got my video camera and told him that I was going to video him and he didn't seem to mind. He added: 'I called the police and they arrived at the door within minutes. On camera: Mr Sawford spotted Neal in the garden of his home in Ely, Cambridgeshire, and filmed him on video camera . Would-be thief: Neal, with his back to camera, claimed that he was hiding in Mr Sawford's garden because he was being chased . 'Apparently they were holding a training exercise in Ely that day for just such an incident so it was quite unlucky for him.' The short clip shows Neal with his back to camera, apparently weighing up his options after he has been confronted by Mr Sawford. Mr Sawford is seen exiting the house and can be heard saying to Neal: 'I'm just going to take a photo of you as I'm not very pleased.' Neal turns to the camera and replies: 'Yes, that's fine.' During Neal's trial, Cambridge Crown Court heard that he had 29 previous convictions for 65 different offences. They included having sex with a woman in front of shocked worshippers in the grounds of Ely Cathedral in July 2010. This is not the first time Neal has been caught red-handed by a homeowner. He was jailed for 29 months in November 2011 after he was chased and caught by a resident in Ely whose house he had just burgled. \n",

This is the forlorn face of a puppy rescued from a back-street breeder’s house where two newborn animals were found buried alive in a shallow grave. Gasping for breath, the two puppies were discovered in the garden by RSPCA officers, having been covered in a layer of soil hours after they were born. The puppies were in such a bad state they had to be put down at the scene. Horrific: A Staffordshire bull terrier puppy rescued from the home of James Perks, his wife Lorraine an Stephen Jenkins . Twenty-four other dogs, some confined to rabbit hutches, were rescued, some ‘barking  uncontrollably as if pleading for help’. Disturbing footage of the discovery was released yesterday after the three people who lived in the house were jailed for a catalogue of animal cruelty charges. James Perks, 74, his wife Lorraine, 49, and their lodger Stephen Jenkins, 35, ran a dog breeding business from their shabby home in Tamworth, Staffordshire, in which the animals ‘lived amongst squalor’. Horrific: Shocked police and RSPCA officers discovered the tiny animals fighting for life after being freshly buried in the back garden of the home of James and Lorraine Perks in Tamworth, Staffs, last year . Terrifying: The helpless Jack Russell puppies were alive when they were pulled from the dirt, but their condition was so bad they had to be put down soon after . Traumatic: Vet Steve Odell who put the puppies to sleep later described the scene as 'one of the most horrific ever witnessed' The four-and-a-half-minute film shows . the officers scouring the back garden, on August 25 last year after a . tip-off from a woman who bought a puppy from the breeders, which died . days later. Officers discovered 15 puppies and . nine adult Staffordshire bull terriers crammed into tiny rabbit hutches . outside, which they were kept in for 23 hours a day. One cramped hutch – measuring just 6ft . wide and 3ft high – contained four adult terriers while other dogs . lived in squalor in the house which was covered in faeces and urine. In the footage, in which 20 RSPCA . officers and police catalogue the shocking abuse of the animals, one . officer discovers a tiny puppy whimpering after being buried alive. An RSPCA inspector is heard saying: . ‘The police officer has just uncovered a puppy that’s been buried in the . garden. Buried alive. ‘Oh my goodness me. She’s found it buried alive.’ Sentenced: Today at Burton Magistrates' Court James Perks, 74, (green coat), his wife Lorraine, 49, (right) and Stephen Jenkins, 35, (far left) were all sentenced to 25 weeks in prison . Upsetting: The RSPCA was alerted to the address by a routine call from a member of the public who bought a puppy from the Perks after seeing a card on a noticeboard . The squirming, dirt-encrusted animal . can be heard crying out as a male vet inspects it and says: ‘It’s so . poorly, euthanasia is going to be required straight away. We’ll have to . put him to sleep.’ The officer then finds a second live . puppy lying near the first. The video finishes with the RSPCA officer . filming the two pups lying almost lifeless on the lawn and concludes: . ‘We’re sorting out immediate euthanasia for these poor puppies.’ The other dogs were confiscated and handed over to the RSPCA for rehoming. Steve Odell, the vet who destroyed the puppies, said it was one of the most horrific scenes he had witnessed. Cruel: Animals were kept in rabbit hutch-like cages and were locked away for 23 hours at a time . The trio were jailed for six months each after admitting ten animal welfare offences and banned for life from keeping animals. Sentencing them at Burton-on-Trent . Magistrates Court  yesterday, chairman of the bench Peter Rolfe said: . ‘If we could have we would have jailed them for  far longer.’ Speaking of the buried puppies, . prosecutor Paul Taylor said: ‘It was Mr Jenkins who buried them.

PUBLISHED: . 11:05 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:52 EST, 18 March 2013 . Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZenca is to axe 700 jobs in the UK as part of restructuring plans that include the likely closure of its Cheshire based research and development facility, Alderley Park, it announced today. The part-British part-Swedish firm said around 1,600 jobs would be cut worldwide over the next three years as it overhauls R&D operations in three major centres in Britain, the U.S and Sweden. The move will see the end of drug research at the Alderley Park facility, for many years a hub of the group's R&D efforts. Job cuts: drugs firm Astrazeneca has announced that up to 1,000 jobs could go in the UK and that its Alderly Park facility will most likely close. Many jobs will be relocated to the nearby Macclesfield centre (pictured). AstraZenca said it was committed to . ‘exploring all options to ensure that Alderley Park has a successful . future.’ Alderley Park currently employs 2,900 people. The drug firm . said 1,600 roles would be relocated to either Cambridge or Macclesfield, . with the majority relocating to Cambridge, but 700 people faced being . made redundant. It added a further 300 further roles could be relocated . outside the UK . The decision . to stop drug research at Alderley Park, the company's largest R&D . site, is a major blow to a region that has relied on a centre where . AstraZeneca and its predecessor ICI have been discovering medicines for . more than 40 years. It is also . another setback for the Government’s ambitions to make Britain a world . leader in pharmaceutical research, following an earlier decision by Pfizer to shut its R&D site in Sandwich, Kent two years ago and . previous cuts by AstraZeneca's former management. Alderley Park lies within the parliamentary constituency of Chancellor George Osborne. Unions accused AstraZeneca of creating a ‘skills crisis’ in the North West by draining the region of highly skilled research and development jobs in the middle of an economic downturn. The GMB said it was \"devastating\" news for the workers, adding that the announcement meant there would be a net job loss of 1,000 in the UK by 2016. GMB national officer Allan Black . said: ‘This is disastrous news for the UK, and for the North West in . particular. The vast majority of the jobs to go are research and . development jobs at the Alderley Park site in Cheshire. There has been . salami-slicing of jobs at this site but this is by far and away the . largest slice of job losses at the site to date. ‘These are cutting-edge R&D jobs . that are both well-paid and essential for a thriving UK economy. Highly-skilled and qualified workers will be put on the scrapheap.’ Unite national officer Linda McCulloch said: ‘AstraZeneca's decision to relocate over 1,000 jobs to Cambridge is a massive blow for the North West. The company is creating a skills crisis for the local economy. ‘After 40 years of success and hundreds of millions of pounds of investment, we are at a loss as to why AstraZeneca is now pulling out of Alderley Park. The region desperately needs this highly-skilled workforce - they make a huge contribution to the economy and to the community. ‘Staff will be shell-shocked by this announcement. Skilled scientific jobs are in short supply and there are many families based around Alderley Park with deep roots in the community. It is going to be a real struggle to relocate families hundreds of miles away to Cambridge.’ The company said the investment reinforced its long-term commitment to the UK and underscored this country's global importance as a location for biopharmaceutical research and development. AstraZenca’s . chief executive Pascal Soriot, who will present his detailed strategy . plans for the group to investors on March 21, said the programme would . lead to $1.4billion (£926.6 million) in one-time restructuring charges. Annualised benefits of the overhaul are expected to reach approximately . $190million by 2016. The . plan includes a £330million investment in a new, purpose-built facility . in Cambridge, where AstraZeneca aims to tap into an environment of . world-class academic and clinical life sciences research. 'This . is a major investment in the future of this company that will enable us . to accelerate innovation by improving collaboration, reducing . complexity and speeding up decision-making,' Mr Soriot said. Science minister David Willetts said: ‘AstraZeneca's decision to invest £330million in a world leading R&D facility in Cambridge is a real vote of confidence in the UK life sciences sector. ‘They chose to make this major investment in the UK after considering options around the world. Our strategy for life sciences provides a very competitive environment in the UK to conduct highly skilled research keeping us ahead in the global race. ‘Clearly the decision to reduce R&D activity at Alderley Park is disappointing. But the government will work closely with AstraZeneca and local partners to ensure this excellent facility has a prosperous future with new opportunities for the site. ‘I have agreed with AstraZeneca and local leaders that a taskforce will be established to co-ordinate work to support Alderley Park staff and the local economy during the transition. This will work to ensure a sustainable, thriving future for the site.’ Mr Soriot, a former Roche executive who took over last October, has his work cut . out to turn around AstraZeneca, which faces loss of patent protection on . key drugs, which analysts expect will lead to an expected fall in sales . of nearly $6billion over the next five years. As . a pure pharmaceuticals group, without the cushion of alternative . revenue streams, AstraZeneca is particularly exposed to patent losses on . key prescription drugs, limiting its room for manoeuvre. But . Mr Soriot hopes to reinvigorate the company by expanding on existing . growth business, including the new heart drug Brilinta, and using . acquisitions to buy in promising new medicines. \n",

            "By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 02:53 EST, 11 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:04 EST, 11 July 2013 . Waring: NHS England chief executive Sir David Nicholson said the health service could not be allowed to 'muddle through' The NHS is on the verge of running out of money and will face a £30billion shortfall by the end of the decade, health officials warned today. Bold changes will have to be made to services, including closing hospitals and merging GP surgeries, to end the culture of ‘muddling along’ which threatens the existence of free healthcare in England. NHS England boss Sir David Nicholson warned of ‘really difficult choices’ about what care is available to cope with an ageing population, more long-term conditions and tighter budgets. A major report by NHS England warns that if the health service continues operating as it is there will be a funding gap of £30 billion between 2013 and 2021. Without a major overhaul of treatment and services there could be a repeat of the Mid Staffs scandal in which up to 1,200 patients needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect. ‘Without bold and transformative change to how services are delivered, a high quality yet free at the point of use health service will not be available to future generations,’ NHS England warned. Officials have not yet decided how the health service must change and have decided to open up national debate to ‘flesh out the no-go areas’. Sir David, who is due to retire next year, said the NHS was in danger of ‘sleepwalking its way to a place where we are presiding over a general reduction in standards.’ After the public debate on the challenges, local health authorities will develop plans on how the health landscape will change in each region. He added: ‘We need to create £30 billion worth of resource in the NHS by cutting off the increase in demand through things like prevention, we need to do it by changing services so that they are delivered in different environment and we need to drive efficiency in the system. ‘The reason it is so important that we have this conversation now is at the end of this year, we are going to have to make some really big, serious decisions about the way in which we invest and allocate resources in 2014-15 and 2015-16. ‘We don't believe (those decisions) can be made in isolation at the centre, nor without proper discussions with the public and patients on how we make that happen.’ He said the health service cannot ‘muddle and sleep walk’ through the challenges it faces or there could be more instances of care failing such as those witnessed in the Stafford Hospital scandal. He added that the current regulatory system around making changes is ‘very slow’ and said that he will be asking the Government to assess how the process can be sped up. Without a major overhaul of treatment and services there could be a repeat of the Mid Staffs scandal in which up to 1,200 patients needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect . However, plans to make changes to health services have been ferociously opposed in the past. For instance, the streamlining of children's heart surgery services ended up in a bitter legal dispute. Campaign groups in Stafford are battling to maintain services at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust - even though Stafford Hospital was at the centre of a care scandal that rocked the system to its core. NHS England said that moves such as the centralisation of services - where care is concentrated in a few specialist centres to ensure quality of care - would form part of the transformation. Medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said that a number of services had the potential to be concentrated at fewer specialist centres, such as treatment for heart attacks and strokes, operations on veins and arteries and bowel surgery. He said that some services would only need be centralised for a limited time, giving the example of pacemakers - in the past the devices, which regulate a patient's heartbeat, could only be implanted by specialist doctors in a small number of centres, but now the procedures are conducted regularly in any hospital which employs a cardiologist. Pressure: The health service needs to adapt to cope with an ageing population and more people living with long-term conditions . Officials also said that patients will also have to take ‘greater control of their health’ - particularly those with long term conditions such as diabetes, depression, dementia and high blood pressure. The new design must provide better services for preventing disease, they said. At present only 4 per cent of the budget is spent on prevention but officials want to examine whether this can be ‘scaled-up over time’. They also said health systems would have to harness emerging technologies more \"efficiently and effectively\" and hospitals will also have to look at delivering care differently. For instance, at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London experts have developed a \"e-intensive care unit\" where specialists remotely monitor patients using high definition cameras, two-way audio systems and other instruments that keep track of patients' vital signs. In a new document, titled ‘A Call to Action’, officials said: ‘The NHS is one of our most precious institutions. We need to cherish it, but we also need to transform it. ‘Future trends threaten its sustainability and that means making some tough decisions now to ensure its future is guaranteed. ‘Even protecting the budget will not address the financial challenges ahead. If the NHS is to survive another 65 years it must change. ‘Preserving the values that underpin a universal health service, free at the point of use, will mean fundamental changes to how we deliver and use health and care services.’ \n",

Kavya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, reacts to winning the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night. \"This has been my dream for so long; I've always wanted to win the bee,\" Kavya Shivashankar, 13, of Olathe, Kansas, told CNN. \"I was just really excited when I was able to go up and spell the last word.\" The eighth-grader won $40,000 in cash and prizes for nailing the final word, \"Laodicean,\" which means lukewarm or indifferent, particularly in matters of politics or religion. This year's bee -- an event that has skyrocketed in popularity thanks to exposure on television and in movies -- started Tuesday in Washington with a record 293 spellers. Kavya endured 15 rounds. In an event that has seen contestants crack under the strain of the national spotlight, Kavya -- competing in her fourth national finals -- appeared composed throughout.  Watch the poised winner describe the thrill » . As she spelled words such as \"phoresy,\" \"hydrargyrum\" and \"huisache,\" she calmly went through the routine of asking each word's pronunciation, origin and roots before ticking their spellings off for the judges. \"I focus so much on my word; I don't really pay attention to all the cameras and photographers and all the media in front of me,\" she said Friday. Kavya's father, who is her spelling coach, would tap his foot in time as she spelled the words, and at one point he appeared so confident that he waved to someone while his daughter was in the middle of spelling a word. Second-place finisher Tim Ruiter of Reston, Virginia, bowed out after misspelling \"Maecenas,\" meaning a generous patron of the arts. Kavya said she would miss competing in the spelling bee, as the rules do not permit her to enter next year. \"It was such a big part of my life, and I love doing it,\" she said. However, she may someday have a new role in the competition. \"If my [little] sister gets to D.C. sometime soon, I'd really love to help and coach her,\" she said. Kavya attends California Trail Junior High School in the Kansas City suburb. Her hobbies include swimming, cycling and traditional Indian dance, according to the contest's Web site.

            "(CNN) -- If you're thinking of setting up an amazing man cave or showing off a ginormous baby bump next year, think again. A northern Michigan school on Friday released its 37th annual list of words and phrases that it believes should be \"banished\" from the English language, and it suggests that some classic -- and perhaps hackneyed -- should get the ax. Lake Superior State University once again solicited people online to nominate terms they consider tired, overused or simply annoying. Based on those submissions, the arbiters at the school decided to put the following on this year's chopping block: \"amazing,\" \"baby bump,\" \"shared sacrifice,\" \"occupy,\" \"blowback,\" \"man cave,\" \"ginormous\" and \"the new normal.\" \"Pet parent,\" \"win the future,\" \"trickeration\" and \"thank you in advance\" also have been unofficially sentenced to linguistic exile for the crimes of excessive and inappropriate usage, according to the university in Sault Sainte Marie on the Canadian border. \"Worn-out words and phrases are the new normal this year, but with some shared sacrifice, we can clean up the language and win the future,\" a school representative said in a written statement. \"With the addition of this year's nominations, the list of words and phrases banished over the years has become ginormous.\" \"Amazing\" -- arguably one of the most overused adjectives in the English language -- topped this year's list of submissions, according to the university. \"Banish it for blatant overuse and incorrect use ... to stop my head from exploding,\" begged Paul Crutchfield from Great Britain, according to the press release. \"Anderson Cooper used it three times recently in the opening 45 seconds of his program,\" said Sarah Howley, a resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan, referring to the CNN anchor. \"My teeth grate, my hackles rise, and even my dog is getting annoyed at this senseless overuse. \"I don't even like 'Amazing Grace' anymore,\" she complained. David Hollis from Hubbardsville, New York, insisted that not all men are enamored with the concept of the traditional man cave. \"It is not just overused, it is offensive to we males who do not wish to hunker (another awful word, often misused) down in a room filled with stuffed animal heads, an unnecessarily large flat-screen TV and Hooters memorabilia,\" he said. \"Not every man wants a recliner the size of a 1941 Packard that has a cooler in each arm and a holster for the remote. So please, assign 'man cave' to the lexicographic scrap heap where it so rightly belongs.\" Jim Eisenmann from Madison, Wisconsin, had some free advice for politicians hitting the campaign trail in 2012: dump \"win the future\" or you may not win the race. \"On its very face, it's an empty, meaningless phrase,\" he explained. \"It basically says that anyone who opposes anything meant to 'win the future' must want to 'lose the future,' which is highly unlikely.\" \"Ginormous\" seemed particularly irritating this time around, with contributors complaining that its usage shows a lack of proper education. \"This combination of gigantic and enormous makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck every time I hear it,\" said Gina Bua of Vancouver, Washington. \"Each utterance reminds me of the high school drop-out that first used this offensive word in my presence.\" \"This word is just a made-up combination of two words,\" adds an Andover, Maine, resident named Jason, who refused to offer his last name. \"Either word is sufficient, but the combination just sounds ridiculous.\" As for \"baby bump\" -- a term used to describe a pregnant woman's rounded belly -- this \"is a phrase we finally need to give birth to, then send on its way,\" declared Mary Sturgeon from Vancouver, British Columbia. \"I'm tired of a pregnancy being reduced to a celebrity accessory. Or worse, when less-than-six-pack abs are suspected of being one,\" said Afton, a respondent from Portland, Oregon. Lake Superior State University's annual \"word banishment\" list was first created at a New Year's Eve party in 1975.

The high price of this abandoned South Granville property - a likely knock-down - could be another sign of the high prices that are locking first home buyers out of the market, analysts said.

The interior devastated by a blaze years ago, Mr Guo said. 'It's been burnt. Other things have been broken or missing. You know, even the tiles on the wall, they are all broken,' he said. 'I don't think you can really live inside it.' 'No one (has) lived inside for at least five years. If someone really wants to buy that property probably they have to knock the old house down.' But while the home may be a shambles, the property does have its perks. The squalid home sits on a considerable tract of land - at 570sqm - and it has a 22m frontage.

The Spanish cyclist made the announcement on Wednesday, just three days after winning the sport's premier event for the third time in four years. \"Alberto Contador has rejected the ultimatum of the Astana team, who had asked for a definitive answer to its offer of a contract renewal for the coming seasons,\" read a statement from his spokesman, the UK Press Association reported. \"Contador had asked for time to consider his future, given the importance of this decision. Although the positions of both parties were not so far apart, the team wanted to know urgently whether or not the winner of the Triple Crown would lead the team in 2011, and that's where the positions began to differ.\" The 27-year-old joined Astana -- which is owned by a group of state-run companies from Kazakhstan -- in 2008. Contador claims third Tour de France title . He had won the Tour for the first time with the Discovery Channel team in 2007, but Astana were not allowed to enter the following year after doping scandals.

Armstrong's team faces hearing over jerseys . With Armstrong leaving after the 2009 event to form his own team, RadioShack, Contador was the clear leader of Astana this year despite the successful return by Alexandre Vinokourov, who had quit in 2008 after being banned for blood doping. Contador has yet decide where he will ride next year, his spokesman said. \"After winning the 2010 Tour de France, Alberto Contador wants to have time to calmly explore all possibilities available to him to ride during the coming seasons, but so far none has been excluded,\" the statement said. \n",
